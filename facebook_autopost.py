Automated Facebook Page poster for the NomadÂ Ov3rland brand.

This script uses the Facebook GraphÂ API to post a photo and caption to a
Facebook Page on a recurring schedule.  Posts are created every Monday and
Thursday at 9:00Â AM Pacific time (America/Los_Angeles).  The message
template includes hashtags and a mention to the NomadÂ Ov3rland account,
and attaches an image and link for the brandâ€™s topâ€‘selling product.

To use this script you need:

  â€¢ A Facebook Page access token with the permissions
    `pages_show_list`, `pages_read_engagement` and `pages_manage_posts`.
    The preceding steps in this task describe how to generate such
    a token via the GraphÂ API Explorer.  Once you have the token,
    update the `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` constant below.

  â€¢ The numeric ID of your Facebook Page.  You can find this in the
    Pageâ€™s About section or by visiting the page and noting the
    number at the end of the URL.  Update the `PAGE_ID` constant
    accordingly.

  â€¢ A publicly accessible image URL and a link to the product you
    want to promote.  Update `IMAGE_URL` and `PRODUCT_LINK` below
    to point to your content.

Save the updated script and run it continuously from a system that
remains online.  For example, you can start it in a background
terminal or use a process manager like systemd.  The script uses
the `schedule` library for scheduling and `requests` for HTTP calls.
Install dependencies via pip if needed:

    pip install requests schedule pytz

Note: The Facebook Page access token expires after about 60Â days.
Regenerate a new token periodically and update `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN` to
avoid authentication errors.
